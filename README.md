Power BI Dashboard


Excited to share my dashboard and findings from the data shared by Data Science Zimbabwe from a mental health survey.

Summary:
The data provided had 60 participants and 51 of the participants are men. Only 43% of the males are stable and all the others are affected by mental health issues. Financial problems are a major source of stress for both employed people and unemployed people. 55% of participants are not stable, and 65% of participants know someone who has mental health concerns. Due to financial constraints and the fact that the majority of people in our country are unaware of mental health difficulties, the majority of these individuals have not sought professional assistance.
Dr Oyewale: “Mental health issues particularly when it relates to children and adolescents are still a taboo in many societies, also in Zimbabwe. Breaking the silence around mental health is urgently needed.”

What needs to be done?
Invest in mental health awareness and promoting understanding.

The dashboard includes information about:
-Number of participants.
-Number of participants that were professionally diagnosed.
-The average fee that is affordable for consulting a professional for an hour long session.
-The number of participants who know someone with mental health issues as a percentage.
-Distribution of stress triggers by number of participants.
-Distribution of mental health status by number of participants.
-The number of participants who are comfortable with consulting a professional as a percentage. 
-Distribution of marital status by number of participants.
-Age range distribution by participants.
